- [ ] Experiment with TextWorld
- [ ] Run LSTM-DQN example
    - [ ] Use LLM embeddings as the state space so it also has baseline commonsense
      knowledge (as recommended by Caroline)
      - Look at the paper that used BERT
    - [ ] The LSTM infuses temporal information. How do I get this in the LLM
      with RL fine-tuning?
- [ ] Use HF TRL and PEFT libraries to fine-tune
